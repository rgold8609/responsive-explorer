It's basically drawing but you need to understand physics. If that sounds like a nightmare beyond comprehension, don't worry because like physics, you can learn it just like anyone else. Unlike physics, you don't need to know math. Big win for non-masochists everywhere! </h1>

"Oh, you think you're cool? I just animate you getting mugged. How do you like that?" See? Just think of the possiblities. Plus, animation is in depressingly short supply. All these companies think AI will take over animation, yeah? Just look at the reception of anything animated with AI. We ain't getting replaced any time soon.</h1>

If you haven't heard the world in general talk about one new big animated series a month, you live under a shipping container at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. The best place to do animation is on YouTube. Even the least remarkable animations have thousands and thousands of views. With practice and a bit of luck, you can obtain a little thing I like to call... profitable job security (yay). </p>
